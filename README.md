I know I know, this project looks simple. but everyone start somewhere, so here is my start/ re-start (again). so -> here we go.

here is my plan

build sth while learning the basics (html, css, javascript, vue, node js, database and basically everything if possible -> then build something/ that can put on my portfolio/ side hustle.)
